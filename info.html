  <h2>Design for Cooperation is a practice-based course aimed at engaging new media art, design, and technology students in discussions and field work in mutual aid and civic participation. Students will be connected to civic engagement-centered organizations (Bed Stuy Strong, Chinatown Mutual Aid La, DSA NYC Electoral, Crown Heights Mutual Aid, Black Lives Matter, Indivisible Brooklyn, and others) that they can become temporarily embedded in in order to research and design tools that can support existing efforts.
  <br><br>The goal is to encourage research-centered, participatory design and steer students away from the technosoutionist approach to problem-solving that Big Tech has popularized. We hope to unlearn old ways and collectively come up with new questions and new prototypes. We will be relying on principles of the Design Justice Network while keeping our practice open to change.
